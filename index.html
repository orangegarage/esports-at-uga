            <p class="pagetext">Esports at UGA is a gaming club at the University of Georgia
                that offers a competitive and casual aspect to various games.
                Our mission is to provide an infrastructure for competitive gaming teams at UGA
                to organize and compete against other colleges, as well as bring together
                distinct teams in order to share resources where necessary.

            <p class="pagetext">
                Q. How much are membership fees?
            </p>
            <p class="pagetext">
                A. There are no membership fees! We do have various fundraisers over the semester
                to fund our activities, so please come out and join us!
            </p>
            <p class="pagetext">
                Q. Is it fine to join if I'm just a casual player?
            </p>
            <p class="pagetext">
                A. Of course! We aim to provide a welcoming gaming community for players of all
                genres, platforms, and skill level. Our members range from Bronze to Grandmaster!
            </p>
            <p class="pagetext">
                Q. When are tryouts held for competitive teams?
            </p>
            <p class="pagetext">
                A. Our tryouts start early in the semester at the discretion of our team captains.
                Please come to our general body meeting (also early in the semester) for more information!
            </p>
            <p class="pagetext">
                Q. What rank do I have to be to join the [game] team? Is there even a [game] team?
            </p>
            <p class="pagetext">
                A. Tryouts are usually open for people of all ranks, but team captains may have minimum requirements separately.
                Please understand that due to limited competitive roster slots not all may get a chance to play in the collegiate leagues.
                You are still welcome to participate in in-houses and other community events. <br>
                We will be updating our team list in the 'teams' section.
                If you are interested in starting a competitive team for an established collegiate league, don't hesitate to contact us!
